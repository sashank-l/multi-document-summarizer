# 📰 Multi-Document Summarization & Analysis System

An end-to-end **AI-powered multi-document summarization framework** that clusters related documents, generates coherent summaries using transformer-based models, and provides rich visual analytics through an interactive Gradio interface.

This system is designed to handle **heterogeneous document formats**, **long-form text**, and **unstructured data**, making it suitable for real-world knowledge analysis, research summarization, and internal knowledge assistants.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔹 Multi-Format Document Support
Upload and process:
- `.txt`
- `.pdf`
- `.csv`
- `.xlsx`
- `.json`
- `.xml`
- `.pptx`

All documents are automatically cleaned and normalized before analysis.

---

### 🔹 Semantic Embedding & Clustering
- Uses **Sentence-BERT (`all-mpnet-base-v2`)** for dense semantic embeddings
- Applies **HDBSCAN** for:
  - Automatic cluster discovery
  - Noise document detection
  - No need to predefine number of clusters

---

### 🔹 Adaptive Summarization Strategy
The system dynamically selects the summarization model based on input length:

| Text Length | Model Used |
|------------|-----------|
| Short (<1024 tokens) | BART (CNN/DailyMail) |
| Medium (<4096 tokens) | Longformer |
| Very Long | Chunked Longformer with overlap |

This ensures **high-quality summaries even for long documents**.

---

### 🔹 Visual Analytics Dashboard
The interface provides the following visual insights:

- **TF-IDF Bar Plot** – Highlights important terms
- **Hierarchical Dendrogram** – Visualizes document similarity
- **t-SNE Projection** – 2D semantic embedding visualization
- **Word Cloud** – Global keyword distribution

All visualizations are generated dynamically based on uploaded documents.

---

### 🔹 Interactive Gradio Interface
- Upload multiple documents at once
- One-click summarization
- Clean bullet-style output
- Visual analytics rendered inline
